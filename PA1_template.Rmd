## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r,echo=TRUE}
activity<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Prerana\\Desktop\\activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
totalsteps<-tapply(activity$steps,activity$date,sum,na.rm=TRUE)
hist(totalsteps,xlab="Total steps per day")
mean(totalsteps)
median(totalsteps)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r,echo=TRUE}
avg_activity<-aggregate(steps~interval,activity,FUN=mean,na.rm=TRUE)
plot(avg_activity,xlab="Intervals",ylab="Average number of steps",type="l")
max_steps<-which.max(avg_activity$steps)
print (paste("The interval with the highest avg steps is ", avg_activity[max_steps, ]$interval))
```
## Imputing missing values
```{r,echo=TRUE}
missingvalues<-length(which(is.na(activity$steps)))
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) {
if(is.na(activity$steps[i])) {
val<-avg_activity$steps[which(avg_activity$interval == activity$interval[i])]
activity$steps[i] <- val 
}
}
activity_impute <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum)
hist(activity_impute$steps,xlab="Number of steps per day", main="Histogram for the total number of steps per day")
mean(activity_impute$steps)
median(activity_impute$steps)
```
## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r,echo=TRUE}
activity_impute$day<- ifelse(as.POSIXlt(activity_impute$date)$wday %in% c(0,6), 'weekend', 'weekday')
avg_activity_impute <- aggregate(steps ~ interval , data=activity, mean)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(avg_activity_impute, aes(interval, steps)) + geom_line()+xlab("5-minute interval") +ylab("avarage number of steps")
```
